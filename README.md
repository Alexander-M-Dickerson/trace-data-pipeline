# TRACE Data Pipeline

A comprehensive, pipeline for processing Enhanced, Standard and 144A TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) corporate bond transaction data. 
It is apart of the [Open Bond Asset Pricing project](https://openbondassetpricing.com/).
This pipeline implements cleaning procedures and error-correction algorithms to produce *high-quality, reproducible* daily and monthly corporate bond panels from raw TRACE transaction data.
The companion repository is [PyBondLab](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti94/PyBondLab/tree/main/examples) which can be used to form corporate bond asset pricing factors.

## Overview

This is a **three-stage pipeline** for building *clean, reliable and reproducible* TRACE corporate bond datasets. 

### Stage 0: Intraday to Daily Processing (WRDS Cloud)  **PUBLIC - READY FOR TESTING**
Processes raw intraday TRACE transaction data to clean daily panels on the WRDS Cloud. Handles three types of TRACE data:
- **Enhanced TRACE**
- **Standard TRACE**
- **Rule 144A bonds**

**Automated workflow:** Run `./run_all_trace.sh` to execute all three data processing jobs in parallel, then automatically generate comprehensive quality reports when complete using SGE job dependencies. All code runs with a "one-push button".

**Status:** Public beta - fully functional and ready to be tested   
**Execution:** WRDS Cloud (WRDS subscription required)  
**Documentation:** See [stage0/README_stage0.md](stage0/README_stage0.md)

### Stage 1: Daily Bond Metrics (Your Home Machine)  **IN DEVELOPMENT**
Calculates comprehensive daily bond metrics from Stage 0 output, including:
- Accrued interest 
- Daily credit spreads
- Duration and convexity measures
- Yield-to-maturity 
- Additional bond characteristics (rating, amount outstanding etc.)

**Status:** In development  
**Release:** End of November 2025  
**Execution:** Your home machine (with WRDS connection)

### Stage 2: Monthly Panel with Factor Signals (Your Home Machine)  **IN DEVELOPMENT**
Produces a clean, error-corrected monthly panel with dozens of corporate bond signals for asset pricing research:
- 50+ bond characteristic signals
- Credit risk factors
- Liquidity measures
- Momentum and reversal signals
- Carry and value signals
- Ready-to-use for monthly portfolio construction -- see [PyBondLab](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti94/PyBondLab/tree/main/examples)

**Status:** In development  
**Release:** End of November 2025  
**Execution:** Your home machine (with WRDS connection)

## Key Features

### Stage 0: Robust Error Correction
- **Decimal-shift corrector**: Automatically detects and fixes multiplicative price errors (10x, 0.1x, 100x, 0.01x)
- **Bounce-back filter**: Identifies and removes erroneous price spikes that revert quickly
- Algorithms designed by Dickerson, Robotti & Rossetti (2025) account for TRACE idiosyncrasies
- **Full documentation Coming November 2025**


### Stage 0: Comprehensive Data Cleaning
- Dick-Nielsen (2009, 2014) cancellation, correction, and reversal filters
- van Binsbergen, Nozawa and Schwert (2025) filters
- Agency trade de-duplication
- Pre-2012 and post-2012 cleaning rules
- Price range filters and volume screens
- Trading calendar and time-of-day filters

### Stage 0: Quality Assurance & Reporting
- Transaction-level audit logs for every filter stage
- CUSIP-level lists of corrected bonds
- LaTeX reports with detailed filtering statistics
- Optional time-series plots for visual inspection (can generate 500+ page reports)
- Row count reconciliation at each processing stage

### Stage 0: Daily Aggregation Metrics
- **Price metrics**: Equal-weighted, volume-weighted, par-weighted, first, last, trade count
- **Volume metrics**: Par volume and dollar volume (in millions)
- **Bid/Ask metrics**: Customer-side value-weighted bid and ask prices

## Quick Start (Stage 0)

### Prerequisites
- WRDS subscription with access to TRACE data
- Python 3.10 or higher
- SSH access to WRDS Cloud

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository on WRDS:**
```bash
ssh username@wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Alexander-M-Dickerson/trace-data-pipeline.git
cd trace-data-pipeline/stage0
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure settings:**
Edit `_trace_settings.py` and set your WRDS username:
```python
WRDS_USERNAME = "your_wrds_username"
```

4. **Run the pipeline:**
```bash
chmod +x run_all_trace.sh
./run_all_trace.sh
```
This executes all three data processing jobs in parallel, then uses SGE's `-hold_jid` to automatically submit the report generation job once all three complete.

**What happens:**
1. Submits 3 parallel jobs: Enhanced, Standard, and 144A
2. Submits a 4th job with `-hold_jid` dependency that waits for all three to finish
3. Data outputs save to dataset-specific folders: `enhanced/`, `standard/`, `144a/`
4. Reports automatically generate and save to `data_reports/` with subfolders for each dataset
5. Total runtime: ~5 hours for the complete pipeline

For detailed instructions, see [stage0/README_stage0.md](stage0/README_stage0.md).

**Quality reports location:**
- `data_reports/enhanced/` - Enhanced TRACE reports
- `data_reports/standard/` - Standard TRACE reports

**Column structure:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| `trd_exctn_dt` | Trade execution date |
| `prc_ew` | Equal-weighted price |
| `prc_vw` | Volume-weighted price (dollar) |

**Expected output size:**
- Enhanced TRACE (2002-present): ~30 million rows
- Standard TRACE (2024-present): ~2-3 million rows
- Rule 144A (2002-present): ~5-8 million rows

**Additional outputs:**
- Audit files documenting filter effects (in dataset subfolders)

## Performance

**Expected Runtime (WRDS Cloud - Stage 0):**

Using `./run_all_trace.sh` (complete automated pipeline):
- **Data processing** (parallel): ~4-8 hours
  - Enhanced: 4 hours
  - Standard: 30-60 minutes
  - 144A: 30-60 minutes
- **Report generation** (after all data jobs complete): ~30-60 minutes
- **Total**: ~5 hours for everything

**How it works:**
The script uses SGE's `-hold_jid` feature to create a dependency chain:
1. Three data jobs run in parallel
2. Report job waits in queue (status `hqw`) until all three complete
3. Report job automatically starts when dependencies are satisfied

**Resource Usage (Stage 0):**
- Memory: ~4-8GB per job (with default chunk_size=250)
- Disk: ~1-2GB per dataset (Parquet format)
- Parallel execution: All three datasets can run simultaneously
